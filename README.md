# 1. Differences between interfaces and types 

#### Even they are looks like similar but they have some difference

If we want to declared a functions types then ```Type``` is good for that. 
 And if we want to declare a object then ```interface``` is good for that. ```Interface``` can be difficult some times when we have to use with array or tuples type,
on the other hand ```Type``` make this easy to use.
